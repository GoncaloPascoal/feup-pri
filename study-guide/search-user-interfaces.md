# Search User Interfaces

## Questions

### ➡️ Identify and describe user interface techniques and elements that can be used to improve user experience in using search systems
The elements of a search user interface can be divided into four main categories:
- **Input:** elements that allow the user to perform queries to satisfy an information
    need (in web search this is typically a single search box)
- **Control:** elements that let the user refine, filter or sort search results or
    reformulate queries (filters based on age, language, type; sorting based on
    price or popularity for online shopping; related terms / query suggestions)
- **Informational:** elements that display information about search results
    (in web search, commonly a box with the document's title, URL and a short 
    description, or, if the search refers to a specific entity, an infobox where
    the layout depends on the type of entity / domain)
- **Personalization:** elements that provide personalization of search results
    based on many factors (location, previous queries if the user is authenticated,
    queries from other users with a similar profile - users like you also 
    searched for...)

### ➡️ Describe how user interaction innovations and experiments can be evaluated
There are three main approaches to evaluating search user interfaces:
- **IR style:** TREC-style environment (dataset, predefined search tasks,
    relevance judegments) applied to interactive search: limited success, since
    precision and recall metrics proved insufficient.
- **Empirical:** evaluates how well the system allows users to complete search 
    tasks; based on observing actual user performance (number of searches, number
    of results visited, time to complete the task). Can also include qualitative
    methods such as interviews.
- **Analytical:** analytical methods can help verify if the SUI design conforms
    to previously developed, effective models.

### ➡️ What are design principles and heuristics?
Guidelines and best practices that can help develop an effective search user
interface that contributes to a positive user experience. Some of these principles are:
- **Visibility:** user should be informed about the state of the system (keep
    the current query in the search box)
- **Language:** adapt vocabulary to end user (use less technical terms if the
    system is intended to be used by a general audience, to facilitate understanding)
- **Consistency:** have a consistent design language (word choice, color, shape)
- **Minimalism:** keep the design simple and clear
